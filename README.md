# FREI
**Flux Reconstruction Educational Implementation**

_by **RedHatTurtle** (FÃ¡bio Mallaco Moreira)_

## Intro
This is my first attempt at writing a functional Chapel code. The code is based on a computational project from ITA's
graduate class CC-299 on High-Resolution methods for CFD. The code attempts to simulate a 1D shock-tube experiemnt with
several 2nd or higher order spatial discretization methods, including the Flux Reconstructiom method as described by
H.T. Huyhn from NASA Glenn.

## Compiling and running instructions

```
chpl -o frei --main-module "Control" frei.chpl
./frei --inputFile=inputExample.toml
```
